# AI Project 1

Implemented in this program is a combined version of iterative deepening search and uniform cost search. For each node in the tree, the algorithm keeps track of the node's cost, as in uniform cost search, but also the depth. The search will perform uniform cost search with a maximum depth on each iteration until reaching a maximum depth of the amount of nodes in the graph. This is to give the program a stopping condition in the case there is not a path betweeen nodes.
